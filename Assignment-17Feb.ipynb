    "MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage.The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.\n",
    "MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data . \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases :\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form. Instead, non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL database system consists of various kind of database technologies. These databases were developed in response to the demands presented for the development of the modern application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high scalability, agility, and flexibility in handling large, unstructured or semi-structured data. This makes NoSQL databases a good choice for use cases such as web analytics, content management systems, real-time data processing, and IoT applications.\n",

    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for handling large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data with high availability, performance, and scalability requirements.

    "Ans :- MongoDB: \n",

    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "    \n",
    "These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Support ad hoc queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indexing :\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Duplication of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. GridFS: MongoDB offers GridFS, a file storage system that allows developers to store and retrieve large files, such as images and videos, as part of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform complex operations that span multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Security: MongoDB offers a range of security features, such as access control, authentication, and encryption, to ensure the security and integrity of the data stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Flexibility: MongoDB's flexible data model and schemaless design make it a good choice for rapidly evolving applications and dynamic environments."
